# Blockchain Banking System  

## 📌 Overview  
The **Blockchain Banking System** is a prototype implementation that demonstrates how decentralized ledger technology can be applied to financial transactions.  
Instead of relying on a centralized database, this system utilizes a blockchain to record all transactions, thereby ensuring **immutability, transparency, and resistance to tampering**.  

This project is intended as a proof-of-concept for understanding the integration of **blockchain principles in banking environments** and serves as an academic and developmental exploration.

## 🚀 Key Features  
- 🔐 **Account Management**: Secure user registration and authentication  
- 💳 **Transaction Handling**: Deposit, withdrawal, and transfer operations recorded on-chain  
- ⛓️ **Blockchain Ledger**: Every transaction is encapsulated within a block and appended to the chain  
- 🛡️ **Integrity & Immutability**: Each block is cryptographically linked to its predecessor, preventing modification  
- ⚡ **Lightweight Architecture**: Built using Node.js and Express for rapid prototyping

## 🛠️ Technology Stack  
- **Frontend:** HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript (vanilla)  
- **Backend:** Node.js with Express.js  
- **Blockchain Core:** Custom implementation of Block, Transaction, and Blockchain classes  
- **Data Persistence:** JSON/local storage (optional database integration)  
- **Version Control:** Git & GitHub

📖 System Workflow

Users create an account and authenticate themselves.
Upon initiating a transaction (deposit, withdrawal, transfer):
A transaction object is instantiated.
This transaction is validated and queued in the pool of pending transactions.
The transaction is then packaged into a block.
The block undergoes validation and is appended to the blockchain ledger.

**The blockchain provides**:

**Non-repudiation:** Transactions cannot be altered once committed.

**Transparency:** Every participant can verify balances and transaction history against the chain.

Deploy full stack on cloud (Heroku, Vercel, AWS, or Netlify + Render)

Enhance frontend with UI frameworks (Material-UI, Tailwind CSS, or Bootstrap)

Add wallet functionality with unique public/private keys per user

Introduce token rewards for validators or miners
